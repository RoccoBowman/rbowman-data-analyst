# **About me**

# **Things I like**

I like food and making food, particularly things like fresh pizza and pasta as well as cookies and cakes. This likely comes from many positive memories in Italian delis as a kid. I enjoy feeding people! 

I love watching the sunset in San Diego with a gelato in my hand and my wife by my side. I also love doggos and hope to adopt one soon.

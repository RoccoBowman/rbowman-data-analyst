# **About me**

My name is Rocco and **I love to solve problems that help people and organizations do what they do best**. I am passionate about learning new skills and ideas that grow my data tool bag which have enabled me to publish peer-reviewed scholarship during my PhD, enhance business intelligence for the US Navy, help first responders manage vital databases, and create interactive museum exhibits.

Use the tabs above to explore some of the solutions I have worked on over the years and the tools I used to make them happen.

# **Things I like**

I like food and making food, particularly things like fresh pizza and pasta as well as cookies and cakes. This likely comes from many positive memories in Italian delis as a kid. I enjoy feeding people! 

I love watching the sunset in San Diego with a gelato in my hand and my wife by my side. The beach has always called to me and the ceaseless waves reset my system.

History has always been an interest of mine, particularly the end of the Roman Republic and writers like Sallust, Livy, Polybius, and Cicero. Besides ancient Rome, perhaps my favorite scholar is Ibn Khaldun who wrote one of the first systematic analyses of the rise and fall of internal orders.
